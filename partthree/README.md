## Part 3: Extending Flyte

We realized that every organization might have different needs, and the existing Flyte system may not already fulfill these integrations in some cases. This is why Flyte is built to be highly extensible. This part will showcase some of the extensibility points. We will dive deeper into integrations and implement custom Flyte types with tasks and type transformers. We will end this talk by doing a hands-on tutorial on developing your own extension!
