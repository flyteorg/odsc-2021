## Part 2: Hands-on Approach to Building Applications With Flyte
This part will give you a hands-on approach to building applications with Flyte. We will get the ball rolling with an introduction to Flyte concepts and a simple “Hello World” application, where we will commute through the ideation, scaling, and iteration phases. We will showcase examples demonstrating some cool Flyte features, followed by a UI walkthrough. We will end this part by talking about the deployment checklist.
